It has validation features, and can be\r\nintegrated with tools like Colander for complex validations.\r\n\r\nCornice can automatically generate Sphinx-based documentation for your APIs.\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](http://cornice.readthedocs.org) \r\n* [Source](https://github.com/mozilla-services/cornice)\r\n\r\n# Circus\r\n\r\nCircus is a process & socket manager. It can be used to monitor and control\r\nprocesses and sockets.\r\n\r\nWith Circus you can control a whole stack from the command-line or a web\r\ninterface, and have real-time statistics.\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](http://circus.io) \r\n* [Source](https://github.com/mozilla-services/circus)\r\n\r\n# Metlog\r\n\r\nMetlog is a service for applications to capture and inject arbitrary data into\r\na backend storage suitable for out-of-band analytics and processing.\r\n\r\nIt's a client-server system that has almost no impact on your application\r\nperformances. You can use it to send stats to Logstash for instance, using\r\nvarious transports like UDP and ZeroMQ.\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](http://metlog-py.readthedocs.org) \r\n* [Source](https://github.com/mozilla-services/metlog-py)\r\n\r\n# Powerhose\r\n\r\nPowerhose turns your CPU-bound tasks into I/O-bound tasks so your Python\r\napplications are easier to scale.\r\n\r\nPowerhose is an implementation of the Request-Reply Broker pattern in ZMQ, with\r\nsome extra features around.\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](http://powerhose.readthedocs.org) \r\n* [Source](https://github.com/mozilla-services/powerhose)\r\n\r\n# Queuey\r\n\r\nWat? Another message queue?\r\n\r\nGiven the proliferation of message queue's, one could be inclined to believe\r\nthat inventing more is not the answer. Using an existing solution was attempted\r\nmultiple times with most every existing message queue product.\r\n\r\nThe others failed (for our use-cases).\r\n\r\nQueuey is meant to handle some unique conditions that most other message queue\r\nsolutions either don't handle, or handle very poorly. Many of them for example\r\nare written for queues or pub/sub situations that don't require possibly longer\r\nterm (multiple days) storage of not just many messages but huge quantities of\r\nqueues.\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](http://queuey.readthedocs.org) \r\n* [Source](https://github.com/mozilla-services/queuey)\r\n\r\n# Tokenlib\r\n\r\nTokenlib is a generic support library for signed-token-based auth schemes. We\r\nare using it to generate HMAC tokens for our\r\n[token-server](https://github.com/mozilla-service/tokenserver) project.\r\n\r\n* [Source & documentation](https://github.com/mozilla-services/tokenlib)\r\n\r\n# Vaurien\r\n\r\nVaurien is a TCP proxy which will let you simulate chaos between your\r\napplication and a backend server.\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](http://vaurien.readthedocs.org) \r\n* [Source](https://github.com/mozilla-services/vaurien)\r\n","name":"Mozilla Services Repositories","google":"","tagline":""}
